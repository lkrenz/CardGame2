In blackjack, you start each round with two cards, dealt a random.You can then get another card by "hitting" or stay with your current cards by "staying". The goal of each round is for  your cards to total more than the dealer's without going over 21, or "busting". The dealer is also dealt two cards at the beginning of each round, but you can only see one. The dealer then takes more and more cards until they either bust or total over 17. Each round awards one point to the winner, or no points if there is a tie, and the first to 5 points wins. If the player or dealer starts with blackjack, the round ends immediately and the correct points are awarded. You can begin the game by running the main function.
